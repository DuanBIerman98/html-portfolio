<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Hello, my name is Duan Bierman, and I’m an aspiring web developer with a passion for technology and coding. I’m constantly working on expanding my skill set and exploring new ways to create meaningful, user-friendly digital experiences. The world of web development excites me because it’s always evolving, and I love the challenge of solving problems and building something from the ground up.

<p>Outside of my professional aspirations, I enjoy a variety of activities. Golf is one of my favorite pastimes, but I also love engaging with other mainstream sports. I’m always ready to dive into a game or match, whether it’s for relaxation or friendly competition. When I’m not on the course or watching sports, you’ll likely find me reading graphic novels or exploring any good book with a captivating genre. I have a broad taste in music, enjoying everything from upbeat tunes to more mellow sounds. Playing video games is another hobby I’m passionate about—it’s a great way to unwind and immerse myself in creative, virtual worlds.</p>

<p>As I continue on my journey as a web developer, I’m excited to see where my skills will take me and how I can contribute to the tech community. I’m always open to connecting with others who share similar interests or who are passionate about innovation, creativity, and technology</p>
