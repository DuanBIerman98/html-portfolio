<h1>Duan's Top 3 Animation Movies</h1>
<h2>Disney and Pixar</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Brave</h3>
<p>The story and the message makes the viewer relate to the happenings but the comedy of the movie just puts the cherry on the cake</p>

<h3>Treasure Planet</h3>
<p>Such a underrated movie and lets me reminisce on my childhood days and the memories that correlate with this movie</p>

<h3>Big Hero 6</h3>
<p>My favorite movie with such a well written story as well as action and comedy with a little bit heartbreak thrown into the mix. Can definitely recommend this movie to any and everyone I know</p>
